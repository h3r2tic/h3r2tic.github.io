Importance sampled screen-space reflections with a novel spatiotemporal filter. I prototyped it in a toy engine written in the Rust language, and later ported to Frostbite, working closely with Yasin Uludag. It first shipped in Mirrorâ€™s Edge and Need for Speed.

Check out the slides for my Siggraph 2015 talk which was part of [Advances in Real-Time Rendering in Games](http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2015/).

Turns out it was a ratio estimator all along. Thanks for pointing that out, Ari Silvennoinen.
