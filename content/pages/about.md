My name is Tomasz Stachowiak, and I'm a professional madman. I mostly tinker with real-time graphics, and occasionally trace my path in Veach-land. By day I'm a reputable software engineer at [Embark Studios](https://www.embark-studios.com/), while at night I bask in the suffering of compilers and GPUs.
